## 开启 WSL2

Before installing WSL 2, you must enable the "Virtual Machine Platform" optional feature.

Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:

```powershell
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
```

Open PowerShell as Administrator and run this command to set WSL 2 as the default version when installing a new Linux distribution:

```powershell
wsl --set-default-version 2
```

You might see this message after running that command:

WSL 2 requires an update to its kernel component. For information please visit https://aka.ms/wsl2kernel.

Please follow the link (https://aka.ms/wsl2kernel) and install the MSI from that page on our documentation to install a Linux kernel on your machine for WSL 2 to use. Once you have the kernel installed, please run the command again and it should complete successfully without showing the message.

My note: After completed these steps don't forget to set your distribution version to WSL 2. You don't need to reinstall the ubuntu. I used this command:

```powershell
wsl --set-version Ubuntu-20.04 2
wsl --export Debian C:\Users\hetao\Desktop\wsl-debian.tar
wsl --unregister Debian
wsl --import Debian C:\Users\hetao\AppData\Local\Packages C:\Users\hetao\Desktop\wsl-debian.tar --version 2
Debian config --default-user root
```

#### [SOLUTION] "The attempted operation is not supported for the type of object referenced." error after Windows Update

Copy below snippet

```powershell
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WinSock2\Parameters\AppId_Catalog\0408F7A3]
"AppFullPath"="C:\\Windows\\System32\\wsl.exe"
"PermittedLspCategories"=dword:80000000
```

Save it as a file wsl.reg 

Execute the file to update the registry

Launch Ubuntu again
